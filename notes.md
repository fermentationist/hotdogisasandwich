# My Hot Dog Thesis

1. All major "hot dog" brands are labelled as either "weiners", "franks" or "frankfurters", and none as "hot dogs". (cite evidence) 
2. All major "hot dog bun" manufacturers label their product as "hot dog buns", and none of them use the word "weiner", "frank" or "frankfurter". (cite evidence)
3. If someone were to order a "hot dog" in a counter service restaurant, and they were given a naked frankfurter, they would likely be displeased. They would perhaps be even more disgruntled, had you presented them an empty bun. 
4. From the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council's website:
> [When it first arrived on American shores from Europe in the late 1800s, it was often referred to as a “Coney Island Sandwich” or “Frankfurter sandwich,” but much like an “ice cream sundae” is simply referred to as a sundae, terminology changes.](http://www.hot-dog.org/press/national-hot-dog-and-sausage-council-announces-official-policy-hot-dog-sandwich-controversy?find=sandwich)
4. A frank or weiner, as well as a bun, are required to constitute a "hot dog"
4. corollary: it is technically incorrect to refer to the sausage itself as a "hot dog"
4. How do we know these two products go together? What emergent properties result from their union, and why is their synthesis deserving of a new name, unrelated in etymology with its parent ingredients?
5. What do we call every other construction of bread (?!) and meat that join to transcend the sum of its parts to become a meal? **We call it a sandwich.**  
6. If not, in which other category does it fit?
7. rebut solipsistic counter-arguments
8. If categories are important, (and by engaging in this debate, you have implicitly ceded this point already) then what other category exists to include the hot dog? 
>[“Limiting the hot dog’s significance by saying it’s ‘just a sandwich’ category is like calling the Dalai Lama ‘just a guy.’   Perhaps at one time its importance could be limited by forcing it into a larger sandwich category (no disrespect to Reubens and others), but that time has passed, said NHDSC President and ‘Queen of Wien’ Janet Riley.  “We therefore choose to take a cue from a great performer and declare our namesake be a “hot dog formerly known as a sandwich.”](http://www.hot-dog.org/press/national-hot-dog-and-sausage-council-announces-official-policy-hot-dog-sandwich-controversy?find=sandwich)

The National Hot Dog and Sausage Council would have you believe that the hot dog is not a mere sandwich, but deserves its own unique category. [John Hodgman made a similar argument in (mis)adjudicating my own case](https://www.facebook.com/hodgmania/posts/judge-john-hodgman-rules-via-the-new-york-times-magazineerin-writes-my-best-frie/10152396173787943/) in the pages of New York Times Magazine, when my best buddy Erin wrote in to complain to the pc guy about my sandwich inclusivity. Though I didn't have the chance to make my own argument before the fake court, Hodgman declared the hot dog to be not a sandwich, but *sui generis*– in a class by itself. 

10. Is the sandwich so unique as to deserve its own category of one? If we care about categories, like "sandwich" and "not sandwich", categories of one are generally undesireable. A category of one is not really a category at all. If every type of bread and meat configuration becomes its own category, then do any sandwiches really exist? Is the Reuben a Platonic Ideal of the sandwich (class), or the one you ate at that deli on your lunch break (instance)? Let's not fall down this hole. We have already agreed that categories matter in some sense, and how many of us (besides the hard working folks at the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council) truly believe that the hot dog is so special as to transcend the category of food to which it so obviously belongs? Let's compare it to another unique sandwich. Is the hot dog really more delicious, or memorable, or unique than the combination of pastrami, saurkraut, Russian dressing and Swiss cheese on grilled rye that we call Reuben? Or is the Reuben also not a sandwich? If not, then what *is* banal enough to qualify as a mere sandwich? Egg salad? Baloney?

# A Call for Sandwich Inclusivity
I propose a new sandwich taxonomy. The problem, I think, is this sandwich binary mindset we are conditioned into. Anything deviating from the idealized image of a "traditional" sandwich (a sandwich that frankly, never existed) is NOT SANDWICH to us. But perhaps instead, there are subcategories or families of sandwich, as in animal taxonomy. Sure, the hot dog doesn't look anything like a tuna salad on sliced whole wheat, but perhaps it just belongs to a different genus of sandwich.

Maybe the time has come to stop arguing about whether or not the hot dog is a sandwich. Perhaps the time has come to begin countless new pedantic and meaningless arguments about *exactly what type of sandwich a hot dog is*. What are its closest relatives, or its ancestors, or descendents? (A corn dog perhaps? Fight amongst yourselves...) Isn't this a much more interesting "bike shed" to overanalyze, now that I have conclusively proven that a hot dog is categorically a sandwich? Go and finally be free of this burden. 
**A hot dog is a sandwich.**

8. why? qui bono?

other arguments to refute: 

• [it isn't meant to be cut in half, and therefore is not a sandwich](https://www.timeout.com/newyork/comedy/the-case-against-hot-dogs-as-sandwiches) 

i don't know what to say about this one. you can cut anything in half with the right tools. if what you mean is, that it would be unseemly to serve someone only half of a hot dog, and they would be at least surprised by the untraditional format, then I agree, but the same could be said of the hamburger. That is also not a sandwich, you say? If you believe that a hamburger is not a sandwich, then there is not going to be anything that I can say to convince you that a hot dog is.

But even if I were to grant the postulate that "if a food is never served cut in half, then it cannot be a sandwich", what does this really tell us about the category "sandwich"? Is this divisibility (or the permissibility of its being so divided?) really at the heart of what makes a sandwich a sandwich? It is at best a useful heuristic for identifying sandwich imposters like the hot dog, at worst, a meaningless coincidence.

• not two slices of bread 
    sub sandwich? hoagie? cheesesteak? italian beef sandwich?
    [pullman loaf](https://www.chicagotribune.com/dining/drink/ct-food-0227-pullman-bread-recipe-20150227-story.html), or ["pain de mie"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_de_mie) is the prototypical sandwich loaf to sandwich purists. Square, baked in an enclosed pan to minimize formation the of crust and create a delicate and moist crumb, and usually sweetened, it is what each of our supposedly requisite two slices. 
    
• bun/bread distinction

• doesn't have "sandwich" in the name
    ice cream sandwich, hamburger, tuna melt
